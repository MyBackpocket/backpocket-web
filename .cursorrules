# Cursor Rules for Backpocket Web

## Package Manager

- This project uses **bun** exclusively. NEVER use npm, pnpm, or yarn.
- Always use `bun add` instead of `npm install`, `pnpm add`, or `yarn add`.
- Always use `bun remove` instead of `npm uninstall`, `pnpm remove`, or `yarn remove`.
- Always use `bun run` for scripts, or just `bun <script>` (e.g., `bun dev`, `bun build`).

## File Naming Conventions

- NEVER rename `proxy.ts` to `middleware.ts` or `@middleware.ts`. The middleware file convention is deprecated in Next.js. Always use `proxy.ts` instead.
- The `proxy.ts` file is the correct Next.js convention for request middleware/proxy functionality.

## Public vs App View Consistency

When implementing UI changes, bug fixes, or new features, always consider whether the change should apply to both views:

- **App view** (`app/app/`): The authenticated/admin experience for logged-in users managing their saves.
- **Public view** (`app/public/`): The public-facing pages visitors see when viewing a shared space or save.

Before completing a feature or fix, ask:
1. Does this change affect a component or pattern that exists in both views?
2. Should the public view have the same behavior/styling for consistency?
3. Are there intentional differences between views that should be preserved?

Common shared patterns to check:
- Save detail pages: `app/app/saves/[saveId]/` ↔ `app/public/s/[saveId]/`
- Save lists/grids: Dashboard components ↔ Public space page
- Reader mode / snapshot display
- Tags, collections, and metadata display
