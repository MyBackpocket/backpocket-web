# Cursor Rules for Backpocket Web

## File Naming Conventions

- NEVER rename `proxy.ts` to `middleware.ts` or `@middleware.ts`. The middleware file convention is deprecated in Next.js. Always use `proxy.ts` instead.
- The `proxy.ts` file is the correct Next.js convention for request middleware/proxy functionality.
