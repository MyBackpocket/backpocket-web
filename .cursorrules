# Cursor Rules for Backpocket Web

## Package Manager

- This project uses **bun** exclusively. NEVER use npm, pnpm, or yarn.
- Always use `bun add` instead of `npm install`, `pnpm add`, or `yarn add`.
- Always use `bun remove` instead of `npm uninstall`, `pnpm remove`, or `yarn remove`.
- Always use `bun run` for scripts, or just `bun <script>` (e.g., `bun dev`, `bun build`).

## File Naming Conventions

- NEVER rename `proxy.ts` to `middleware.ts` or `@middleware.ts`. The middleware file convention is deprecated in Next.js. Always use `proxy.ts` instead.
- The `proxy.ts` file is the correct Next.js convention for request middleware/proxy functionality.
